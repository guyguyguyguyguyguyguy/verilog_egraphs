Running branch for carrying out EGraph rewrites over assertions.

The egraph code expects: 
	1. An input file containing the assertions 
	2. An optional output file (defaulted as "assertionOutput.out") 
	3. An optional timeout in seconds (defaulted at 10 seconds)

To run the code:
	1. cd into assert_egraph
	2. run: "cargo build -- release" to build exectuable
	3. run executable using ./target/release/assert_egraph -f "input-file" -o "optional output-file" -t "optional timeout"
