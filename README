Contains two python files for minimisation and maximal universal subset (MUS).

#### Minimisation

Found in "minimise_assertions.py"
 - This takesa  file with assertions and generates a new file with some redundent assertions removed.
 - This uses a greedy lattice based approad 


#### Maximal universal subset (MUS)

Found in "minimal_satisfiable_assignment.py"
 - Using the Minimal Hitting Set (MHS) as an approximation of the Minimal Satisfiable Assingment (MSA), the algorithm iteratively refines thiapproximation until an MSA is found. The MSA is then used to generate a Minimal Universal Subset that captures underspecified variables in the assertion set.
