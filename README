Contains two python files for minimisation and maximal universal subset (MUS).

#### Minimisation

Found in "minimise_assertions.py"
 - This takesa  file with assertions and generates a new file with some redundent assertions removed.
 - This uses a greedy lattice based approad 


#### Maximal universal subset (MUST)

Found in "maxmimal_universal_subset.py"
 - Given a set of assertions, the set is looped over and at each iteration it returns the variables in the assertions that can be univeraslly quantified (are under-specified)
